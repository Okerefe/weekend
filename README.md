# Raven Weekend App!

**Raven Weekend App** is a Simple Laravel Application [(Demo Hosted Here)](https://weekend.deravenedwriter.com/), that Computes the amount of Weekend between any two dates. It also gives the options to download the txt and pdf file of the report.
It harnesses some pretty complex logic in processing the amount of weekend betwen any given date.
It was built using Laravel for the backend and some  light weight Vue.js at the front end.

# Laravel
Thomas Edison gave us the light bulb while Elon Musk took Electric cars and the Space race to another level.
But Taylor Otwell gave us Laravel.
I mean We PHP Developers finally have something we can brag about.
We finally have a framework whose Documentation one can enjoy reading (strange right?).

Laravel is simply Magic. I don't know another way to put It.
and yes, we all love magic.

So ya, it's Laravel... right?
Oh, It still depends. How much of Laravel do you really want in your "Laravel" Project.

Do you enjoy the abracadabra features, or do you like to see some logic when you look at your code?
Do you want everything that is happening to be in your front or behind the scenes?
Do You Prefer just writing a clean-up code to a task or event right where You can see them? Or you would rather go with Observers and Events...


Which do you prefer and which is the right way to go.
Well, I am not here to debate about that.
But I believe We can all agree on one simple fact. and that Is, that Laravel is Just Awesome


Their Fluent Testing APIs, their Robust Notification system, 1 minute authentication system, Eloquent, Reflections.. to name but a few..
It's Just Simply amazing.
and no matter how you choose to use It. Either harnessing all of its full potential and dark magic. or taking it slowly and comfortably seeing your logic.
Whichever way you go, Laravel will still make sure you have a much simpler and more thrilling process and experience than just about any other Framework out there.
